\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is simply a short summary of Ambedkar's book on Untouchability\cite{ambedkar1}. Useful for people who do not have the patience to read it completely. I have tried to simply present Ambedkar's point of view here and whereever my opinion is expressed, I have specifically put it in a gray box.
